# Project Description of Product Advertising Data & Social Media Consumer Behavior

The impact of advertising expenditures on sales volume was assessed using Multiple Linear Regression Analysis. Hypothesis Testing evaluated the effects of different advertising strategies on sales and engagement. Finally, Classification Analysis predicted purchasing outcomes based on consumer attributes such as salary and age.

## 1. Hypothesis Testing

### Dataset: [Product Advertising Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fayomi/product-advertising-data)
**Objective:** To test specific hypotheses regarding the impact of various advertising strategies on product sales and customer engagement.

**Hypotheses and Tests:**

- **Impact of Advertising Medium on Sales:**
  - **Hypothesis:** Sales differ significantly across various advertising mediums such as TV, online platforms, and billboards.
  - **Test:** Conduct F-Test to determine if there are statistically significant differences in sales across advertising mediums.

- **Effect of Budget Allocation on Product Sales:**
  - **Hypothesis:** Higher advertising budgets lead to increased product sales.
  - **Test:** Perform t-tests to compare sales means between different budget groups.

## 2. Regression Analysis

### Dataset: [Product Advertising Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fayomi/product-advertising-data)
**Objective:** Apply regression analysis to quantify how various factors, including advertising spend across different channels and product types, influence sales volume.

**Regression Analysis:**

- **Influential Factors on Sales Volume:**
  - **Analysis:** Implement multiple regression to evaluate how expenditure on different advertising channels and product types affects sales.
  - **Approach:** Analyze regression coefficients, assess model performance using R-squared values to ensure the reliability of results.
  - **Additional Analysis:** Analyze how much different product types coefficients are useful in predicting the model.

## 3. Classification Analysis

### Dataset: [Social Media Consumer Buying Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshisatre/social-advertisement-dataset)
**Objective:** Predict the purchasing outcome of the consumers based on salary and age, using classification techniques.

**Model Development:**

- **Feature Selection and Model Training:**
  - Perform Univariate and Bivariate analysis.
  - **Models:** Train Logistic Regression and multiple logistic regression to classify if the purchasing outcome of the consumers was successful or not.

- **Evaluation and Comparison:**
  - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall.
  - Validate models on a separate test set to assess generalization capabilities.

## Conclusion

**Synthesis of Findings:**
- Summarize key insights from hypothesis tests, regression analyses, and classification models.
- Highlight effective advertising strategies and the impact of various factors on sales and campaign success.
